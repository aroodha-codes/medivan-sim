        REPLACES the previous reactive wall-follower.

        The old left-wall-follow heuristic could not achieve coverage: with no

        contact froze it permanently (measured: 6.3 % coverage after 4000
        steps, so the 85 % MAPPING -> NAVIGATION handover never fired).

        This implementation uses the classic frontier-exploration algorithm
        (Yamauchi, 1997) against the SLAM occupancy grid:

          1. A *frontier* is a known-free cell adjacent to an unknown cell --
             i.e. the boundary of what has been mapped so far.
          2. BFS over known-free grid cells finds the nearest reachable
             frontier from the robot's current cell.
          3. The robot drives to it with proportional heading control.
          4. On arrival (or if the target becomes stale) a new frontier is
             selected. When no frontiers remain, the map is complete.

        This guarantees monotonic progress: every frontier reached converts
        unknown cells to known, so the frontier set strictly shrinks.

        REPLACES greedy nearest-frontier selection.

        Why the old approach failed (measured over 5 seeds: 57.7 % of the map
        mapped, std 116 cells, frontiers never exhausted):

          * It targeted the single CLOSEST frontier cell. Because the camera
            reveals cells immediately around the robot, the nearest frontier
            is almost always one cell away, so the robot replanned every few
            ticks and oscillated instead of committing to a direction.
          * One isolated frontier cell scores the same as a 40-cell opening
            into an unexplored ward, so it had no notion of information gain.

        This implementation:
          1. Labels frontier cells into connected clusters (8-connected).
             A cluster's size is a direct proxy for information gain.
          2. Scores every cluster with one shared BFS distance field:

                 utility = size / (distance + FRONTIER_DIST_BIAS)

             which prefers large openings but discounts distant ones, the
             standard cost-utility trade-off from Yamauchi / Burgard.
          3. Applies hysteresis: an already-selected goal keeps a bonus
             multiplier so the robot commits to a target instead of
             thrashing between two similar clusters.
